Common Lisp Exercises by Oliver Otcasek

For this project, I have created 5 list functions, 4 set functions, and 7 math functions 
in the Lisp programming language using purely functional programming techniques based around recursion. 

To run the main part of the program, run the "main" function as (main). 

then, if the function requires another argument, you may type anything. 
The program will quit and move to the next function.

Function List:
List functions:

append (l1 l2) -> appends list l1 and l2.

reverse (l) -> reverses list l.

addtoend (a l) -> adds input a to the end of list l.

remove-all (a l) removes all input a from list l.

map (q l) -> calls function q on all elements of list l.



Set functions:

member (a s) -> searches list s for input a.

cardinality (a) -> returns the cardinality of the set a.

difference (s a) -> finds a single difference between list s and list a.

intersection (s a) -> takes the intersection of lists s and a.



Math functions:

factorial (i) -> returns the factorial of the number i.

gcd (n l) -> Euclid's algorithm.

primep (a) -> tests if input a is prime.

nth-prime (a) -> finds the ath prime number.


Please refrain from using this dishonestly.
